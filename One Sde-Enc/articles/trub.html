    <h1>Trubactors' Interview Series</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>
        In the May of 2022, a youtuber named Trubactor, whose only OSC content up to this point <br>
        were reactions of the show BFB, was thinking of doing an interview with a<br>
        member of the ONE team. On the 30th, he uploaded a (now unlisted) video of him interviewing<br>
        Cheesy HFJ. He would reupload the video in June 6th.<br>

        This would only drive Trubactor to interview more people. On June 8th, Trubactor would<br> 
        interview ThatPerson.<br>

        He would interview more people, with the latest (as of now) being SnowyPackel.

    <h2>The Incident</h2>
    <h4>"GRAMPS, NOT MY INTERVIEWS!!!"</h4>
    <hr/>
    <h3>
        On July 17th, three days after another OSC interview, he would hastily announce the following on<br> 
        the ONE discord server:<br>
    </h3>
    <p>    
        WHAT THE [expletive]<br>
        MY INTERVIEWS<br>
        THEY GOT TAKEN DOWN<br>
        NOT BY ME<br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Because of this, various interviews nearly became lost media. One of these interviews was one<br>
        of RangoAnimations. The interview is still not up to this day.<br>
        
        A day later, the videos were reinstated onto Trubactors' YouTube channel, where they can still be watched today.<br>
        
        Through a reply on one interview, it was found out that his grandfather had involuntarily deleted the episodes.
